## Security and Monitoring Technologies

### Correlating Security Event Information
* Artificial intelligence can solve security data overload
* Security Informatoin and Event Management (SIEM)
    * Central secure collection point for logs
    * Source of artificial intelligence (AI)
* SIEMs have access to log entries from across the organization

### Tuning and Configuring SIEMs
* Point relevant security logs to the SIEM's log repository
* Write once, read many system, prevents unauthorized changes
* Synchronizing system clocks, use Network Time Protocol (NTP)

### Continuous Security Monitoring
* maintaining ongoing awareness of information security, vulnerabilities, and threats to support decisions

### Data Loss Prevention
* technology solutions that prevent loss and theft of data
* Host-Based DLP: uses software agents installed on a single system
* Network-Based DLP: scans network transmissions for sensitive information
* Pattern Matching: recognizes known patterns of sensitive information such as SSNs
* Watermarking: identifies sensitive information using electronic tags

### Network Access Control
* intercepts network traffic coming from unknown devices and verifies that the system can access it
* uses 802.1x authentication

### Secure Mail Gateways
* a relay for emails that allows for security checking
* Four different actions when checking an email
    * allows a message through to its destination
    * blocks or quarantines a message
    * tag the message with a warning
    * encrypt message if it contains sensitive contents

### Data Sanitization Tools
* data sanitization programs overwrite the data stored on disk

### Syeganography
* process of hiding data in large files
* most common technique is hiding data in high-resolution images
* images with embedded text may be posted in plain sight
