## Mobile Device Security

### Mobile Connection Methods
* Cellular Networks: available in most urban/suburban areas, covers larges distances
* Wi-Fi networks cover shorter distances with higher bandwidth
* Satelitte Networks
* Near-Field Communication (NFC): covers very short distances using electromagenetic induction
* Bluetooth: covers distance up to 30ft
* USB connections allow wired connectivity for mobile devices

### Mobile Device Security
* Four digit passcodes do not provide adequate security
* Biometric authentication offers a convenient, secure alternative method
* Full Device Encryption: protects sensitive information
* Remote wiping technology removes data from lost or stolen devices
* Lock mobile device after period of inactivity

### Mobile Device Management
* Perform device configuration management
* Prevent users from modifying security settings
* Control data stored on devices
* Manage applications installed on devices
    * Application Blacklisting: prohibit the installation of specificed applications
    * Application Whitelisting: only allow the installation of approved applications on mobile devices
* Storage Segmentation: separates sensitive information
* Containerization processes sensitive data inside a secure, encrypted mobile app

### Mobile Device Tracking
* Loss of mobile devices introduces confidentiality and financial risks
* Asset tracking software: manages device inventories
* Geofencing: alerts when a device leaves a defined area

### Mobile Application Security
* Authentication: use strong credential management

### Mobile Security Enforcement
* MDM solutions allow the lockdown of mobile device configurations
* Third-party app stores may contain unsafe code
* jailbreaking phones create added security risks
* Mobile devices must be patched with current operating system firmware
* Device unlocking allows portability among service providers

### Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
* There may be policy issues with BYOD
* Legal and privacy issues with BYOD
    * users should understand monitoring
    * user acceptance of intrusive monitoring is unlikelt

### Mobile Deployment Models
