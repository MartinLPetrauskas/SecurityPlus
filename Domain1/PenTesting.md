## Pen Testing & Vulnerability Scanners

### Vulnerability Assessment Tools
* Two Types:
    * Passive Tools
        * Observe Activity
    * Active Tools
        * Interact with machines

### Honeypots
* Attractive decoy machines
* No legit activity on it
* Great for catching hackers

### Honeynets
* Attractive decoy networks

### Protocol Analyzers
* Allows us to peek into network traffic
* There are some privacy concerns since we can see what users are doing
* i.e. Wireshark

### Scanners
* Three Types:
    * Port Scanners: looking for open ports, i.e. nmap
    * Vulnerability Scanners: test open ports for active vulnerabilities
    * Application Scanners
    
### Threat Assessment
* Threat: external force that can jeopardize security
* Vulnerability: security weakness that a threat might exploit
* Risk: likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability

### Assessment Techniques
* Baseline reporting:
    * provides initial review of a system's security status
    * compares current configuration and expected baselines
    * can be automated with tools
* Attack Surface Review:
    * enumerates all possible paths of attack
    * make heavy uses of scanners
    * adopt the mindset of an attacker
* Code Reviews:
    * performs assessments of software security
    * peer code review for an extra set of eyes
* Architecture Review:
    * dissects how everything fits together
    * analyzes the interactions of various systems

### Penetration Testing
* testers actually attack systems and networks
* verify that the threat exists and exploits known vulnerabilities
* Three types of Penetration Tests:
    * White Box: attackers have full knowledge
    * Black Box: attackers have no knowledge, like a real attack
    * Gray Box: attackers have some knowledge of the systems and resources
* Pivoting: after exploiting a vulnerability, attackers use that system as a base from which to target other systems on that network
* Persistence: after exploiting a vulnerability, attackers install tools on that system to allow future access

### Advanced Vulnerability Scanning
* Non-intrusive scanning: won't disrupt system operations
* Intrusive Scanning: might disrupt system operations
* False Positive: when a scanner reports a vulnerability that does not exist
* False Negative: when a scanner fails to report a vulnerability that really does exist
