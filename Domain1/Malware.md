## Malware
* short for "malicious software"
* comprised of two parts:
    * propagation method: how it spreads
    * payload: malicious action
    
### Type of Malware
* Virus: spreads from system to system by human action
* Worm: spreads from system to system on their own, user does not have to do anything, require vulnerable systems
    * RTM Worm
    * Stuxnet
* Trojan Horse: disguise themselves as beneficial programs, but performs unwanted actions in the background
    * Remote Access Trojan: specifically used for remote access
* Adware: malware which displays advertisements and generate money for the malware author
    * changing default search engine
    * pop-up advertisements
    * replacing legitimate advertisements
* Spyware: gathers information without the user's knowledge or consent
    * logging keystrokes
    * monitoring web browsing
    * searching hard drive and cloud storage
* Ransomware: blocks access to files and computer until a ransom is paid
    * i.e. Cryptolocker ransomware
        * usually arrived in email attachment
        * encrypted local documents
        * demands ransom on short notice
* Backdoors:
    * provides workaround access to a system
    * hardcoded accounts
    * default passwords
    * unknown access channels
    * i.e. Wargames (the movie)
* Logic Bombs:
    * deliver a triggered payload
    * date/time occurring
    * file contents
    * API call results

### Advanced Malware
Rootkits:
* takes advantage of the root account and its special user privigles
* can deliver backdoors, spyware, etc.
* user-mode rootkits run with user level credentials
* kernal-mode rootkits: run with highest level credentials
Polymorphism:
* Typical anti-virus uses signature detection to find viruses
* Polymorphic viruses change their code or encrypt themselves with a different key each time
Armored Viruses:
* Attempts to prevent reverse engineering of viruses
* Writing virus in obfuscated assembly language
* Blocking use of debugging tools

### Botnets
Botnets:
* network of infected machines
* botnets are usually rented out
* deliver spam
* engaging in DDOS attacks
Command & Control Networks:
* takes advantage of network communications
* Internet Relay Chat
* Twiiter, Facebook, etc.
* Peer to Peer networks

### Zero Days and Advanced Persistent Threats
Zero Days:
* vulnerability in a product that has not yet been discovered by the vendor
* Window of Vulnerability: time between the release of vulnerability and the vendor patch
APT:
* well-funded and highly skilled
* typically government sponsored
* Have access to zero days
* Willing to work persistently toward a specific goal
