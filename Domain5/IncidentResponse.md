## Incident Response

### Security Incidents
* Security Event: any observable action on a computer system that impacts security
* Adverse Security Event: any security event with negative consequences
* Security Incident: any adverse event that violates security policies
* Security professionals must identify and respond to adverse events and incidents
* Attack Vector Categorization:
    * External Media
    * Attrition
    * Web
    * Email
    * Improper usage
    * Equipment loss of theft
    
### Preparing for Incident Response
* IR Program Components
    * Policy and plan documentation
    * Procedures for incident handling
    * Guidelines for communicating externally
    * Structure and staffing model for the team
    * Description of relationship with other groups
* Incident Response Policy
    * Provides foundational authority for the program
    * Defines incidents that fall under policy
    * Include an incident prioritization scheme
* Incident Response Procedures: contain the details of your plan
    * Notification
    * Escalation 
    * Reporting
    * System isolation
    * Forensic analysis
    * Evidence handling
* Building an IR Team
    * Management
    * Information security
    * Subject matter experts
    * Legal cousel
    * Public Affairs
    * Human resources
    * Physical security
* Diverse team membership builds relationships that are crucial during an incident
* Testing incident response plans ensures readiness for real incidents

### Incident Identification and Containment
* Monitoring is crucial to effective incident indentification
* Incident Data Sources:
    * IDS and IPS
    * Firewalls
    * Authentication Systems
    * Integrity monitors
    * Vulnerability scanners
    * System event logs
    * NetFlow records
    * Anti-malware packages
* Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM): security solution that collect information from diverse sources, analyzes it for signs of security incidents, and retains it for later use
* The first reports of an incident may come from external sources
* Threat intelligence solutions provide important strategic and tactical insights
* First responders must act quickly
* Highest priority of a first responder must be containing damage through isolation

### Escalation and Notification
* Escalation and Notification Objectives:
    * Evaluate incident severity based upon impact
    * Escalate response to an appropriate level
    * Notify management and other stakeholders
* Triaging Incidents
    * Low-Impact Incidents:
        * have minimal potential to affect security
        * are normally handles by first responders
        * don't require after-hours response
    * Moderate-Impact Incidents:
        * Have significant potential to affect security
        * Trigger incident response team activation
        * Require prompt notification to management
    * High-Impact Incidents:
        * May cause critical damage to information systems
        * Justify an immediate, full response
        * Require immediate notification to senior management
        * Demand full mobilization of incident response team
* First responders must have the ability to quickly activate a full incident response process

### Incident Mitigation
* Control damage and loss to the organization through containment
* Containment Strategy Evaluation:
    * Damage potential
    * Evidence preservation
    * Service availability
    * Resource requirements
    * Expected effectiveness
    * Solution timeframe
* Balance business needs and security objectives
* Attackers may detect containment actions
* Mitigation ends with stability

### Eradication and Recovery
* Remove effects of the incident and return to normal operations
* Technical recovery efforts:
    * Rebuild compromised systems
    * Remove malware
    * Disable breached accounts
    * Restore corrupted or deleted data
* Reconstitution corrects vulnerabilities
* Redediation Efforts:
    * Applying security patches
    * Updating firewall rules
    * Implementing intrustion prevention
    * strengthening access controls
* Use a phased approach to recovery and reconstitution

### Lessons Learned & Reporting
* Lessons learned: provides incident responders with an opportunity to reflect on the incident response efforts and offer feedback that will improve the organization's response to future incidents
* Create a report that includes lessons learned and recommendations
