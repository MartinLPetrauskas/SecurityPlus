## Data Security & Privacy

### Understanding Data Security
* Data at Rest: Data stored for later use on a hard drive, or other data storage environment
* Data in Motion: Data being sent over a network between two systems
* Data Security Controls:
    * Clear policies and procedures covering data use and security
    * Encryption to protect sensitive information
    * Access controls on stored data
* Big Data:
    * big data is the use of datasets much larger than those that may be handled by conventional data processing and analytic techniques
* Big data requires special security considerations

### Data Security Policies
* Data Security Policy Criteria
    * Foundational authority for data security efforts
    * Clear expectations for data security responsibilities
    * Guidance for requesting access to information
    * Process for granting policy exceptions
* Data Classification Policies: describe security levels
* Classification is used as the basis for other data handling requirements
* Data Storage Policies
    * Appropriate storage locations
    * Access control requirements
    * Encryption requirements
* Data Transmission Policies
    * appropriate data transmissions
    * Encryption requirements
    * Acceptable transmission mechanisms
* Data Lifecycle policies: describe end-of-life for data
    * Data Retention Policies: specify the minimum and/or mximum periods that an organization will retain different data elements
    * Data Disposal Policies: describe proper techniques for destroying data that is no longer needed by the organization

### Data Security Roles
* Data Owner are business leaders with overall responsibility for data, they set policies and guidelines for their data sets
* Data stewards handle the day-to-day data governance activities, they are delegated responsibility by data owners
* Data Custodian actually store and process information and are often IT staff and members
* Privacy officers are responsible for ensuring that the organization meets its privacy obligations

### Data Privacy
* Personally Identifiable Information (PII): records that may be associated with a specific indivudal
* Protected Health Information (PHI): health records about an individual patient
* Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP) outline 10 components of data privacy

### Limiting Data Collection
* Notice and consent is just the first level of restriction on data collection
* Never collect undisclosed information even if it seems "incidental"
* Minimize Information Collected: delete unneeded information quickly
* Ensure that your data collection practices are fair and lawful
* Monitor Third Parties: verify their privacy practices

### Privacy Assessments
* Privacy Threshold Analysis (PTA): evaluates the use of personal information to determine whether privacy controls are necessary
* Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA): Evaluate the privacy controls used by an IT system to determine whether they are sufficient
    * Ensures that PII handling meets all applicable requiriments
    * Identifies risks associated with handling PII within an IT system
    * Examines privacy controls and recommends mitigations
