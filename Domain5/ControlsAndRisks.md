## Controls and Risks

### Security Controls
* Security Controls: procedures and mechanisms that an organization puts in place to manage security risks
* Defense in Depth: Multiple controls for one objective
* Categorizing Controls by Purpose:
    * Deterrent controls: designed to discourage attack attempts
    * Detective controls: designed to identify attack attempts
    * Preventive controls: designed to stop an attack in progress
    * Corrective controls: designed to help recover from an incident
* Categorizing Controls by Mechanism:
    * Technical controls: use technology to achieve security objectives
    * Administrative controls: use management policies and processes to achieve security objectives
    * Physical controls: deter, detect, or prevent unauthorized physical access to a facility
    * Compensating controls: fill gaps left when you are unable to implement other required controls
    
### Security Policy Framework
* Security Policies:
    * Provide the foundation for a security program
    * Are written carefully over a long period of time
    * Require compliance from all employees
* Security Standards:
    * Provide specific details of security controls
    * Derive their authority from policies
    * Follow a less rigorous approval process
    * Still requires compliance from all employees
* Security Guidelines
    * Provide security advice to the organization
    * Follow best practices from industry
    * Suggestions, not required
* Security Procedures
    * Outline a step-by-step process for an activity
    * May require compliance, depending on circumstance

### Security Policies
* Factors Affecting Security Policy
    * Culture of the organization
    * Industry
    * Regulatory environment
* Common Policies:
    * Information Security Policy:
        * Designation of individual responsible for security
        * Description of security roles and responsibilities
        * Authority for creation of security standards
        * Authority for incident response
        * process for policy exceptions and violations
    * Privacy Policy
    * Acceptable Use Policy:
        * Responsible use policy
        * Describes how individuals may use information systems
        * Prohibits illegal activity
        * Describe what personal use is allowed

### Risk Assessment
* Risk Assessment: identifies and prioritizes risks
* Threat: external force jeopardizing security
* Threat vectors are the specific methods that threats use to exploit a vulnerability
* Vulnerability: weakness in security controls
* Risk is the combination of a vulnerability and a corresponding threat
* Never conduct penetration testing or vulnerability testing without authorization
* Prioritize risk by likelihood and impact
* Likelihood: probability that a risk will occur
* Impact: amount of expected damage
* Qualitative Risk Assessment: use subjective ratings to evaluate risk likelihood and impact
* Quantitative Risk Assessment: use numeric ratings to evaluate risk 
        
### Quantitative Risk Assessment
* Perform quantitative risk assessment for a single risk and asset pair
* Asset Value (AV): dollar value of an asset
* Asset Valuation Techniques:
    * Original cost
    * Depreciated cost
    * Replacement cost
* Exposure Factor (EF): expected % of damage to an asset
* Single-Loss Expectancy (SLE): expected dollar loss if a risk occurs one time
* AV * EF = SLE
* Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO): number of times a risk is expected to occur each year
* Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE): expected dollar loss from a risk in any given year
* SLE * ARO = ALE
* Time to restore service depends upon whether a component is repairable
* Mean Time To Failure (MTTF): average time a non-repairable component will last
* Mean Time Between Repair (MTBR): average time gap between failure of a repairable component
* Mean Time To Repair (MTTR): average time required to return a repairable component to service

### Risk Management
* Risk Management: process of systematically analyzing potential responses to each risk and implementing strategies to control those risks appropriately
* Risk Management Strategies
    * Risk Avoidance: changes the organization's business practices
    * Risk Transference: shift the impact of a risk to another organization
    * Risk Mitigation: reduces the likelihood or impact of risk
    * Risk Acceptance: accept the risk without taking action
    * Risk Deterrence: takes action that disuade a threat from exploiting a vulnerability
    
### Risk Visibility & Reporting
* Risk Register: tracks risk information
* Risk Register Contents:
    * Description
    * Category
    * Probability & Impact
    * Risk Rating
    * Risk Management Actions
* Risk Register Information Sources
    * Risk assessment results
    * Audit findings
    * Team member input
    * Threat intelligence: shares risk information, may be used both strategically and operationally
