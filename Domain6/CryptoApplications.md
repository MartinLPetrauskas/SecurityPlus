## Cryptographic Applications

### Digital Rights Management
* Digital Rights Management (DRM): provides the owners of intellectual property with the technical means to prevent the unauthorized use of their content through the use of encryption technology
* Business Applications of DRM:
    * Protect trade secrets and other intellectual property
    * Limit redistribution of information
    * Revoke access after expiration date

### Specialized Use Cases
* Some cryptographic applications require operation at extremely low power levels
* Smart cards are common example of low power cryptography
* Specialized cryptographic hardware allows operations at low power levels
* Networked cryptography requires very low latency
* Dedicated cryptographic hardware operates at low latency
* High resiliency requires the protection of encrypted data against loss
