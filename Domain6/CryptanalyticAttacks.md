## Cryptanlaytic Attacks

### Brute Force Attacks
* Brute-force attacks: repeatedly guess keys
* Brute-force attacks are also called known ciphertext attacks
* Keyspace: the set of all possible encryption keys usable with an algorithm
* Modern algorithms are suseptible to brute force attacks
* Flawed algorithms may be vulnerable to brute-force attacks

### Knowledge-Based Attacks
* Frequency Analysis: detects patterns in ciphertext
* Known Plaintext Attack: attacker has access to an unencrypted message
* Chosen Plaintext Attack: attacker can create an encrypted message of their choice
*
