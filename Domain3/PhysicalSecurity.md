## Physical Security

### Site & Facility Design
* Data centers contain massive quantities of valuable information and computing resource
* Server rooms may also contain sensitive information in less secure locations
* Media storage facilities may require additional attention, particularly if in remote locations
* Evidence storage locations must preserve the chain of custody
* Wiring closets offer access to eavesdroppers and network intruders

### Data Center Environmental Controls
* Data centers have significant cooling requirements
* Expanded Envelope: between 64.4-80.6 degrees  farnehgith 
* High Humidity: leads to condensations that may damage electronic equipment
* Low Humidity: leads to static electricity that may damage electronic equipment
* Dew Point Range: between 41.9 and 50.0 degrees farhenheight 
* HVAC systems keep temperature and humidity under control
* Servers draw cool air in the front and expel hot air out the back
* The hot aisle/cold aisle approach makes cooling data centers more efficient

### Data Center Environmental Protection
* Fire is a grave threat in a data center environment
* Fires require three sustaining elements: heat, fuel, oxygen
* Fighting fires with water is dangerous in a data center environment
* Fire Extinguishers:
    * Class A: Common combustibles
    * Class B: Flammable Liquids
    * Class C: Electrical Fires
    * Class D: Heavy metal fires
    * Class K: Kitchen fires
* building-wide suppression system often use water
    * Wet Pipe System: contain water in pipes ready to deploy when a fire strikes
    * Dry Pipe System: do not contain water until a value opens during a fire alarm
* Chemical systems deprive fires of oxygen
* Electromagnetic Interference:
    * Is generated by all electronic equipment
    * Interferes with normal operations of other equipment
    * Enables eavesdropping attacks
    
### Physical Security Control Types
* Deterrent controls are intended to prevent an intruder from trying to access a secure area
* Preventive controls are intended to block an intruder from accessing a secure area
* Detective control are intended to alert security personnel to a potential or actual security violation
* Technical controls use technology to deter, prevent, or detect security violations
* Administrative controls rely upon business processes to enhance physical security
* Compensating Controls: fill known gaps in security

### Physical Perimeter Security
* Locks restrict physical access
* Preset locks use physical keys, the lock is preset to open for the correct key
* Cipher locks require the user to enter the correct combination
* Card reader locks require that the user present a magnetic stripe of proximity access card
* Network distribution cables must also be secured

### Visitor Management
* Visitor Procedures:
    * Describe allowable visit purposes
    * Explain visit approval authority
    * Describe requirements for unescorted access
* All visitor access to secure areas should be logged

### Hardware Security
* Mobile devices are valuable and easy to steal
* Encryption protects sensitive data on mobile devices from theft
* Cable locks protect laptops and other portable technology against theft
* Vaults protect electronics and other sensitive items from theft when not in use
