## Embedded System Security

### Industrial Control Systems
* Industrial Control Systems monitor and control industrial processes
* Hackers love attacking ICS systems
* The systems are often not well secured
* ICS Types:
    * Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
    * Distributed Control Systems (DCS)
    * Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC)
 
### Internet of Things
* smart technology is everywhere
* Smart devices are computer controlled and network connected
* embedded systems refers to smart devices
* Use of difficult-to-update software and underlying OS
* Connect to home and office wireless networks
* Connect back to cloud services for command and control

### Securing Smart Devices
* Require regular updates
* Automatic Updates: install without the user's knowledge or intervention when published by the device manufacturer
* Manual Updates: require that the user check for updates and manually download and install them when available
* Firmware Version Control: updated applied in orderly fashion
* Security Wrappers: vets requests for embedded systems

### Secure Networking for Smart Devices
* Network Segmentation: separates untrusted devices
* Segmenting embedded devices increases network security
* Application Firewalls add protection for embedded devices
* Embedded devices security controls are effective for mainframes as well

### Embedded Systems
* System on a Chip: combines processing, memory, networking and other embedded system components on a single chip
* Real time operating systems: provide reliable and secure computing for IoT devices
