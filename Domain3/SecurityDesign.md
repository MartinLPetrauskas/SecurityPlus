## Security Design

### Legislative and Regulatory Compliance
* Four main types of compliance obligations
    * Criminal Law: deter and punish acts detrimental to society
    * Civil Law: resolve disputes, covers almost any matter that isn't covered by criminal law
    * Administrative Law: facilitate effective government
    * Private Regulations: flow from contractual relationships
    
### Security Frameworks and Reference Architectures
* Security Framework: a collection of standards and practices designed to form a solid approach to information security
* Reference Architecture: a description of the specific controls that would achieve an organizations's security objectives

### Developing Security Baselines
* Baseline security standards describe the minimum requirements
* Baselines are usually generic, but they may include specific requirements for handling different categories of information
* System configuration managers automate policy deployment
* Monitoring is critical: watch for baseline deviations

### Leveraging Industry Standards
* Sources of Security Standards:
    * Vendors
    * Government Agencies
    * Independent Organizations

### Defense in Depth
* Organizations should use multiple, overlapping security controls to achieve each of their security objectives
* Eavesdropping:
    * Encryption through virtual private networks
    * Encryption at the application layer
    * Segmentation with VLANs
* Access Control
    * Network Access Control
    * Role-appropriate VLANs
* Perimeter:
    * Network Prevention System
    * Firewall
    * Router with ACLs
