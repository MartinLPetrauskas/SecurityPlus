## Secure Staging and Development

### Software Staging and Release
* Development Environment: allows developers to create and modify code
* Test Environment: facilitates human and automated testing
* Statging Environment: prepare code for release to production
* Production Environment: provides live services to end users
* Sensitive Data: should be prohibited or tightly controlled in non-production environment
* Code Deployment: should be performed by someone other than a development, particularly in production

### Software Risk Analysis and Mitigation
* Risk analysis identifies issues
* Risk mitigation reduces their likelihood and impact
* Integrate Security with the SDLC
* Sandboxing isolates development code

### Security Baselines and Integrity Measurement
* Baselines provide a snapshot in time
* Deviations are changes from the baseline
* Development Baselines: track code changes made by developmers during the software development process
* Integrity Measurement: track changes to code after deployment, noting unexpected changes
*
